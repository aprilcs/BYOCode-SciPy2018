# BYOCode-SciPy2018
Preparing your data and code for computationally reproducible publication: A hands-on, BYOCode workshop for researchers

# Abstract
This is a step-by-step, practical tutorial to prepare Python research code and data for computationally reproducible publication. The tutorial starts with some brief introductory information about computational reproducibility, but the bulk of the tutorial is guided work on participant code and data. The tutorial covers the basic best practices for publishing code and data, and participants move through organizing their files, creating a codebook, preparing their code for reuse, documentation, and submitting their code and data to share.

# Outline

## Essential information about computational reproducibility (teaching 20 mins / exercises 10 mins)

* Question: What is computational reproducibility?
* Learning objectives:
  * Define computational reproducibility and its relevance to researchers.
  * Explore examples of computationally reproducible research.
* Key points:
  * Computational reproducibility is the foundation upon which all other forms of reproducibility are built.
  * Benefits the researcher themselves as well as promotes progress and reuse in research.
  * Requires sharing of data, code, and computational environment necessary to rerun research code.

## Organizing your code and data (teaching 10 mins / exercises 20 mins)
* Question: How do we organize our data and code in preparation for publication?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe best practices for file organization.
  * Centralize your research into one repository according to best practices.
  * Learn how to separate data, code, and results.
* Key points:
  * Create one repository or directory that holds all related research files.
  * Organize your research to separate data, code, and results.
  * Save results explicitly.

## Preparing your data for publication (teaching 10 mins / exercises 20 minutes)
* Question: How do we communicate important information about our data?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe best practices for data documentation.
  * Learn what to include in a codebook.
* Key points:
  * Examine examples of well made codebooks.
  * Create a codebook for your data.

## Preparing your code for publication (teaching 10 mins / exercises 40 mins)
* Question: How do we prepare our code for sharing?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe best practices for code sharing.
  * Learn how to prepare your code to be used by others.
* Key points:
  * Use relative rather than absolute paths.
  * Create a master script that runs your scripts in sequence.
  * Specify your environment and package versions.

## Documenting your research for reuse (teaching 10 mins / exercises 40 mins)
* Question: What information must I include for reuse?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe best practices for documentation.
  * Describe the FAIR Principles for discoverable research.
  * Prepare the minimum documentation for reuse.
* Key points:
  * Create a README file.
  * Include essential metadata.
  * Choose a licence.

## Sharing your code and data (teaching 10 mins / exercises 40 mins)
* Question: How can I share code and data reproducibly?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe possible tools for publishing code and data.
  * Submit your code and data for publishing on Code Ocean.
* Key points:
  * There are many tools and platforms for sharing code and data.
  * Sharing a container rather than just code and data improves reproducibility.
  * New tools can make configuring a container for research efficient.

## Integrating reproducibility into your research workflow (optional, depends on time)
* Question: What are the practical steps a researcher can take to improve reproducibility?
* Learning objectives:
  * Describe best practices for improving reproducibility throughout the research workflow
  * Describe tools to support reproducibility.
* Key points:
  * Plan for reproducibility from the start to save time through project organization and electronic lab notebooks.
  * Keep track of your research through preregistration, version control, and documentation.
  * Report and share your methods and materials completely and transparently.
